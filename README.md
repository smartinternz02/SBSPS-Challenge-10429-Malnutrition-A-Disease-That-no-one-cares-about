extract insights to aid in understanding the factors contributing to malnutrition and potential solutions.

**Project Goals**
- Analyze malnutrition data to identify trends, patterns, and key factors contributing to malnutrition.
- Utilize IBM Cognos Analytics to create interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration and communication of insights.
- Collaborate with experts and stakeholders to develop informed recommendations for addressing malnutrition.

**Usage**
1. Data Preprocessing: Use the relevant notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to preprocess the data, clean it, and prepare it for analysis.
2. Data Analysis: Analyze the cleaned data using various techniques outlined in the notebooks.
3. IBM Cognos Analytics: Import the cleaned data into IBM Cognos Analytics and create interactive visualizations and dashboards for data exploration.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Document your findings, insights, and recommendations based on the analysis and visualizations in the `reports` directory.
